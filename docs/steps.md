### Update: Navigation Structure Enhancement

**Time:** Follow-up task completed

**Changes Made:**

1. **Updated Router Configuration**
   - Modified `app_router.dart` to use nested routes structure
   - Profile and Settings routes are now children of the home route
   - This ensures pages stack on top of home instead of replacing it

2. **Enhanced App Bar Behavior**
   - All pages now have proper app bars with theme toggle
   - Nested navigation automatically provides native back buttons
   - Removed manual "Back to Home" buttons in favor of native navigation
   - Added guidance text about using the native back button

3. **Navigation Flow**
   - Home page (/) serves as the base
   - Profile (/profile) and Settings (/settings) stack on top
   - Back button automatically navigates to the previous screen
   - Maintains navigation history properly

**Technical Details:**
- Used GoRouter's nested route structure with child routes
- Cleaned up unused imports (go_router) from screen files
- Enhanced user experience with native navigation patterns
