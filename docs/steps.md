2. **Added sample routes with go_router**
   - Created `lib/screens/` directory with three screens:
     - `home_screen.dart` - Main home page with navigation buttons
     - `profile_screen.dart` - User profile page
     - `settings_screen.dart` - Settings page with theme toggle
   - Created `lib/router/app_router.dart` with GoRouter configuration

   - Updated main.dart to:
     - Wrap app with ProviderScope
     - Use MaterialApp.router with GoRouter
     - Configure light and dark themes
     - Implement dynamic theme switching based on provider state

**Architecture:**
- Uses Riverpod for state management
- GoRouter for declarative routing
- Material 3 design system
- Provider pattern for theme management

**Files Modified/Created:**

### Update: Navigation Structure Enhancement

**Time:** Follow-up task completed

**Changes Made:**

1. **Updated Router Configuration**
   - Modified `app_router.dart` to use nested routes structure
   - Profile and Settings routes are now children of the home route
   - This ensures pages stack on top of home instead of replacing it

2. **Enhanced App Bar Behavior**
   - All pages now have proper app bars with theme toggle
   - Nested navigation automatically provides native back buttons
   - Removed manual "Back to Home" buttons in favor of native navigation
   - Added guidance text about using the native back button

3. **Navigation Flow**
   - Home page (/) serves as the base
   - Profile (/profile) and Settings (/settings) stack on top
   - Back button automatically navigates to the previous screen
   - Maintains navigation history properly

**Technical Details:**
- Used GoRouter's nested route structure with child routes
- Cleaned up unused imports (go_router) from screen files
- Enhanced user experience with native navigation patterns

### Task: Implement Persistent User Preferences

**Time:** 2025-07-23 - Persistent storage implementation completed

**Objective:** Add persistent storage for user preferences like theme mode, language, and text direction using shared_preferences.

**Steps Completed:**

1. **Added SharedPreferences Package**
   - Added `shared_preferences: ^2.3.2` to pubspec.yaml
   - Best practice for persistent storage in Flutter apps

2. **Created PreferencesService**
   - Created `lib/services/preferences_service.dart`
   - Centralized service for managing all app preferences
   - Supports theme mode, language code, and text direction
   - Provides sync and async methods for reading/writing preferences

3. **Enhanced Theme Provider**
   - Updated `lib/providers/theme_provider.dart` to use persistent storage
   - Theme preferences now persist across app restarts
   - Theme state is loaded from storage on app initialization

4. **Implemented Locale/Language Support**
   - Created `lib/providers/locale_provider.dart` with LocaleState and LocaleNotifier
   - Supports multiple languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, French)
   - Automatic RTL detection for RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.)
   - Manual text direction override option
   - Persistent language and direction preferences

5. **Updated Main App Configuration**
   - Modified `lib/main.dart` to initialize PreferencesService on app start
   - Added locale provider to main app widget
   - Configured Directionality widget for RTL/LTR support
   - App now loads saved preferences on startup

6. **Enhanced Settings Screen**
   - Updated `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` with comprehensive preference controls
   - Language dropdown with multiple language options
   - Text direction toggle with visual indicators
   - Real-time preference updates with immediate UI changes

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Persistent Theme**: Dark/light mode survives app restarts
- **Multi-language Support**: English, Arabic, Spanish, French
- **RTL/LTR Support**: Automatic detection + manual override
- **Centralized Preferences**: Single service for all app settings
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes apply immediately across the app

**Architecture Benefits:**
- **Data Persistence**: User preferences are remembered between sessions
- **Performance**: Efficient storage using native platform preferences
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new preference types
- **User Experience**: Settings apply instantly without app restart

**Files Modified/Created:**
- pubspec.yaml (added shared_preferences dependency)
- lib/services/preferences_service.dart (new - centralized preferences)
- lib/providers/theme_provider.dart (enhanced with persistence)
- lib/providers/locale_provider.dart (new - language and RTL support)
- lib/main.dart (added preferences initialization and locale support)
- lib/screens/settings_screen.dart (enhanced with language and direction controls)
